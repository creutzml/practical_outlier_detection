# practical_outlier_detection
Code developed to implement Practical Outlier Detection (POD), a method for identifying and classifying the type of functional outlier in a univariate, random sample of functional data. This repository is created for the manuscript submission of Creutzinger and Sharp (2024), "Practical Outlier Detection in Functional Data Analysis" and for Chapter 2, Creutzinger (2024).

## General Structure of Repository
The contents of this repository are organized into three main folders: R Code, Data, and Figures. A short description of each folder is given below.

- **R Code**: folder that contains all R scripts for implementing POD, creating a random sample of functional data with outliers present, reproducing simulations, and reproducing the case study.
- **Data**: the saved simulation .RData files are provided here for easy reproducibility of the simulation figures and tables. If any new simulation iterations are run, a new folder is created in this directory and the new simulation results are saved there. 
- **Figures**: copies of the plots and figures presented in the manuscript.

## R Code: Details
The primary R script of interest is `practical_outlier.R`, which contains the function to implement my functional outlier detection method, Practical Outlier Detection (POD). 

**An Example**:
```
# Load the Ojo et al. (2021) library for easy data generation
library(fdaoutlier)

# Create an example data set
test_data_obj <- simulation_model7()
test_data <- test_data_obj$data

# Implement POD
pod_test <- pod_fda(test_data, cutoff = "classical1.5")
```

The remaining scripts in the folder allow one to recreate the simulation results and case study results found in the manuscript. Specifically, a description of each script is given below:
- `simulaton_model_b.R`: function to simulate a random sample of functional data with magnitude, shape, and two types of both magnitude and shape functional outliers. Adapted from Ojo et al.'s (2021) function `simulation_model1()` in the package `fdaoutlier`.
- `simulation_model_b_only.R`: function to simulate a random sample of functional data with two types of both magnitude and shape functional outliers. Adapted from Ojo et al.'s (2021) function `simulation_model1()` in the package `fdaoutlier`.
- `tvdmss_mc.R`: adapts the code originally created by Huang and Sun (2019) to correct for an error that occurred when there is a "positive" MSS outlier. The original function can be found in package `fdaoutlier` by Ojo et al. (2021).
- `plotting_script.R`: allows one to recreate Figures 1, 6, and 7 in the manuscript.
- `run_outlier_sim.R`: allows one to run a single parameter combination (at a time) of the simulation described in Section 3.2.
- `results_outlier_sim.R`: summarizes and reproduces the simulation results of Section 3.2. Specifically, this script reproduces Table 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.
- `run_outlier_sim_for_type.R`: allows one to run a single parameter combination (at a time) of the simulation described in Section 3.3. 
- `results_outlier_sim_for_type.R`: summarizes and reproduces the simulation results of Section 3.3. Specifically, this script reproduces Table 2, Figure 4, and Figure 8.
- `world_population.R`: reproduces the results of the case study presented in Section 4. Specifically, this script reproduces Table 3 and Figure 5.

## Data: Details
The raw results of the simulation described and summarized in Section 3.2 are saved as `sim_results_all.RData` and the raw results for Section 3.3 are saved as `sim_results_for_type.RData`. When a new simulation is implemented by `run_outlier_sim.R`, a new folder named `sim_*current date*` is created and the simulation results are saved there. When a new simulation is implemented by `run_outlier_sim_for_type.R`, a new folder named `sim_type_*current date*` is created and the simulation results are saved there.
